# ispdb

This is a cli for the great project ISPDB. You can find it here: [autoconfig](https://github.com/thunderbird/autoconfig).

Per the autoconfig README:

## ISPDB - Generic database of mail server configuration

It contains the server names and configuation for almost all large ISPs in the world. Most ISPs with a user base of
more than 0.1% are included here.

Be sure to read the docs below:

* [Autoconfig mechanism documentation](https://www.bucksch.org/1/projects/thunderbird/autoconfiguration/),
including file format definition and explanations.
* [File format](https://www.bucksch.org/1/projects/thunderbird/autoconfiguration/config-file-format.html)
* [How to configure your domain](https://www.bucksch.org/1/projects/thunderbird/autoconfiguration/#Configuration_server_at_ISP)
without being added to the ISPDB here. This is useful for small ISPs and domains that are not open to the public.
* [Original project page - for reference](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Autoconfiguration)

[ISPDB](https://github.com/thunderbird/autoconfig) was created by Ben Bucksch.
